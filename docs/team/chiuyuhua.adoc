== PROJECT: slaveFinder()

---

== Overview

slaveFinder() is a resume management application that helps recruiters manage most of the hiring process. It allows recruiters to easily look for quality job applicants through convenient filtering of resumes' various fields, and sort these applicants into different parts of the selection process. Other features include automated scheduling of interviews based on recruiter's availability and analytics of job applicants.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: added *Analytics* feature end-to-end
** What it does: 
*** Consolidates and breaksdown the various fields data of applicants, such as gender breakdown, number of applicants in each school, number of applicants in each major and average grade. 
*** Analytics can be done on specific lists in the selection process, such as only on applicants that were interviewed or selected for the job. `analytics applicant`, `analytics kiv`, `analytics interview`, `analytics shortlist`, `analytics` 
** Justification: 
*** Recruiters often want to know the quality of applicants that apply to their company, and use this data to improve their hiring process or recruit marketing strategies.
*** Furthermore, many companies are concerned about diviersity in their team. Such analytics can inform them if they are getting (or selecting) a sufficiently diversed pool of applicants.
** Highlights: In addition to processing the various fields data in corresponding lists, analytics data is presented in a visually intuitive manner consisting of different charts to suit the nature of the person field.

* *Major enhancement 2*: restructured the original AB4 UI code to suit the context of slaveFinder(), and provide UI component for various commands added by other team members. 
** What it does: 
*** Consist of two scenes: First scene shows 2 panels consisting of a list of all applicants and a list of all job openings. Second scene shows 4 panels, each representing a specific part in the hiring process for a specific job opening: "Applicants, KIV, Interviewed, Shortlist". 
*** Filtering of applicants through field data is also shown visually on software, where filtered keywords are "stored" (and removed when needed) above the corresponding lists.
** Justification: Being able to filter applicants and sort them according to the selection process is the core value add of our software, and hence essential to be visually represented and for user to interact with each list accordingly. 
** Highlights: Enable UI for the following commands:
*** `DisplayJob`: Switch UI scene to show 4 panels for specific job
*** `list`: Switch UI scene to show all applicants and all job openings
*** `filter`: Filter keywords stored above corresponding lists
*** `deleteFilter` & `clearFilter`: remove filter keywords stored above corresponding lists
*** `movePerson`, `addPerson`: allows Person to be moved and displayed at various list on the `applicantsPanel`, `kivPanel`, `interviewPanel`, `shortListPanel`
*** `createJob`: allows new job to be added as a `JobCard` on the `JobsPanel`
*** `analytics`: new window that displays analytics data on different charts.

=== Analytics Feature
==== Current Implementation

The analytics is facilicated by the Analytics class. Analytics data are generated in real time depending on the specific job currently on display in the software by the user. Hence it will not be saved as states in the `versionedAddressBook`. It pulls required person list to generate data from Model, which consists of lists: `displayedFilter`, `activeJobAllApplicants`, `activeJobKiv`, `activeJobInterview`, `activeJobShortist`. An `Analytics` object will be created by Analytics class, storing the various required data generated, and pass it to Logic and UI for display.  

Given below is the sequence diagram for `analytics`:

=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `JobListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

=== Use case: View Analytics

*MSS*

1. User requests to display various lists of applicants from one of the jobs in all job openings lists
2. slaveFinder() shows lists of persons for specific job
3. User requests to view analytics for specific list of persons
4. slaveFinder() shows analytics results
+
Use case ends.
