By: `W15-3`      Since: `Feb 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `JobListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* InterviewScores stores the scores of the applicant and is used in considering an applicant for hiring.
* NRIC is used as a unique identifier for an applicant.
* School of the applicant (no restrictions on the input for this).
* Race and Gender can only take specific values as spelled out in the user guide and it is used in the analytics portion of the app.
* JobsApply should always be present when a for a person.
* PastJobs, KnownProgLang and InterviewScores are optional.
* PastJobs, KnownProgLang and Major stores values as strings therefore, "Engineer, Data Scientist" are stored as one PastJobs.

// end::model[]

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::jobs[]
=== Job Feature
==== Current Implementation

The Job feature is facilitated by the Job class and UniqueJobList Class.
UniqueJobList contains Jobs by composition while Jobs contains Person by aggregation. The main Database contains one uniqueJobList which holds all the current job openings.

image::uniqueJobListCompositeJobAggregatePerson.png[width="650"]

==== Storage Implementation

Storage of the Job relies on the JsonAdaptedJob and the JsonAdaptedJobPersonList classes to store and load jobs. Instead of storing a Person in the job, due to the relationship of aggregation,
the Nric is stored instead. At load time, the UniqueJobList is only created after the UniquePersonList has been created and fills the jobs using the data from UniquePersonList.


==== Design considerations

===== How to associate job with the vanilla AB4 structure
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store under addressbook class
** Pros: Can easily adapt methods of add, delete, undo and redo to work with job
** Cons: Violates Single responsibility principle as addressbook class now manages both Job and Person data
* **Alternative 2:** Create an overarching class that contains both addressbook which is a database of Person(s) as well as a Job container class.
** Pros: Reduced coupling
** Cons: Implementation of an overarching class would require a major overhaul of current system especially Logic and UI components

===== How to store Person in Job in JSON file
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store only one unique person identifier and retrieve person
** Pros: Saves space extremely significantly by avoiding repeat of data due to many jobs having the same person
** Cons: When loading, requires more time and violates Law of Demeter as Job class now has access to UniquePersonList which is a class contained in Addressbook
* **Alternative 2:** Store full person data in Job
** Pros: Faster loading and adheres to Law of Demeter as the Job does not access more that what it is associated with
** Cons: Greater memory usage

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter Feature

With the filter feature, users can input specific parameters that act as conditions for slaveFinder() to conditionally update the `UniqueFilterList` and filter the `UniquePeronList`. Using these parameters, slaveFinder() shows applicants contains the specified parameters. Filter is visble and can combine or be deleted.

Command Format:
**`filter [FILTERLISTNAME] fn/FILTERNAME [<prefix>/<parameter>]...`
**`deleteFilter [FILTERLISTNAME] fn/FILTERNAME`
**`clearFilter [FILTERLISTNAME]`

[NOTE]
* FILTERLISTNAME indicate which Job list this command will used.

==== Add Filter

The command format for Adding a Filter is:

Format: `filter [FILTERLISTNAME] fn/FILTERNAME [n/NAME] pp/PHONE_NUMBER] [nric/NRIC] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [g/GENDER] [r/RACE] [m/MAJOR] [s/SCHOOL] [gr/GRADE] [is1/INTERVIEWSCORESQ1] [is2/INTERVIEWSCORESQ2] [is3/INTERVIEWSCORESQ3] [is4/INTERVIEWSCORESQ4] [is5/INTERVIEWSCORESQ5] [j/JOBS_APPLY]... [kpl/KnowPROGLANG]... [pj/PASTJOB]...`

[NOTE]
====
* If multiple fields are provided, this command will filter the `UniquePersonList` by `AND` logic among multiple fields.
* If multiple keywords are provided in one command, this command will filter the `UniquePersonList` by `OR` logic among multiple keywords.
* Example: `filter fn/filter1 m/CS s/NUS` changes the UI to display applicants whose school is NUS *AND* major is CS. `filter fn/filter2 s/NUS NTU` changes the UI to display applicants whose school is NUS *OR* NTU.
====


Upon entering the `filter` command, the `filter` command word is stripped from the input and the argument fields are passed into the `FilterCommandParser` class. The FilterListName will be stripped from the argument and parse to `LISTNAME` object. `FilterCommandParser` tokenizes the other argument string using `ArgumentTokenizer` object, The regular expressions will be checked and mapping each parameter to it's respective prefix in an `ArgumentMultiMap` object. `FilterCommandParser` then creates a `predicatePersonDescriptor` object using the parameter
values in `ArgumentMultiMap` for each filter. If invalid parameters are specified by the user, or if an invalid `FILTERLISTNAME` was be inputed, or there is no filter name is provided, then `FilterCommandParser` throws a `ParseException` and displays an error message to the user.

If valid inputs are provided, `predicatePersonDescriptor` will be created and `FilterCommandParser` will return a `FilterCommand` with parameters `predicatePersonDescriptor` and `FilterName` and `FilterListName`. `FilterCommand` then creates a Predicate Manager object (implements Java 8’s Predicate interface) using the parameter values in `predicatePersonDescriptor` for each filter condition, and combines them into one single Predicate using the and() function in Predicate interface. After that, `FilterCommand` calls the addPredicate method in Model to set the Predicate List (indicated by FilterListName).In the end  `FilterCommand` calls the updateFilteredPersonList method in Model to update applicants using all current undeleted PredicateManager object. UI will change and displaying all undeleted Filter name label and the Person who evaluates the set Predicate to true. If repeated filterName are specified by the user, or if an non-empty `FILTERLISTNAME` was be inputed in All Job Screen mode, or if no `FILTERLISTNAME` was be inputed in JOb Detail Screen mode, then `FilterCommandParser` throws a `CommandException` and displays an error message to the user.

===== Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of events when the `filter fn/nus` command is entered by the user:

image::FilterSD.png[width=800]
Figure: Sequence diagram illustrating the interactions between the
`Logic` and `Model` components when `filter` command is called.

==== Delete Filter

The command format for Deleting a filter is:

Format: `deleteFilter [FILTERLISTNAME] FILTERNAME`


Upon entering the `deleteFilter` command, the `deleteFfilter` command word is stripped from the input and the argument fields are passed into the `DeleteFilterCommandParser` class. The FilterListName will be stripped from the argument and parse to `LISTNAME` object. `DeleteFilterCommandParser` tokenizes the FILTERNAME.  If an invalid `FILTERLISTNAME` was be inputed, or there is no filter name is provided, then `DeleteFilterCommandParser` throws a `ParseException` and displays an error message to the user.

If valid inputs are provided, `DeleteFilterCommandParser` will return a `DeleteFilterCommand` with parameters `FilterName` and `FilterListName`. `FilterCommand`. After that, `DeleteFilterCommand` calls the removePredicate method in Model to set the Predicate List (indicated by FilterListName).In the end  `FilterCommand` calls the updateFilteredPersonList method in Model to update applicants using all current undeleted PredicateManager object. UI will change and displaying all undeleted Filter name label and the Person who evaluates the set Predicate to true. If no filterName are found, or if an non-empty `FILTERLISTNAME` was be inputed in All Job Screen mode, or if no `FILTERLISTNAME` was be inputed in JOb Detail Screen mode, then `DeleteFilterCommandParser` throws a `CommandException` and displays an error message to the user.

==== Clear Filter

The command format for Clearing a filter is:

Format: `clearFilter [FILTERLISTNAME] `


Upon entering the `clearFilter` command, the `clearFfilter` command word is stripped from the input and the argument fields are passed into the `ClearFilterCommandParser` class. The FilterListName will be stripped from the argument and parse to `LISTNAME` object. `ClearFilterCommandParser` tokenizes the FILTERNAME.  If an invalid `FILTERLISTNAME` was be inputed, then `ClearFilterCommandParser` throws a `ParseException` and displays an error message to the user.

If valid inputs are provided, `ClearFilterCommandParser` will return a `ClearFilterCommand` with parameters `FilterName` and `FilterListName`. `FilterCommand`. After that, `ClearFilterCommand` calls the clearPredicate method in Model to set the Predicate List (indicated by FilterListName).In the end  `ClearFilterCommand` calls the updateFilteredPersonList method in Model to update applicants using an always true PredicateManager object. UI will change and displaying an empty filter panel and the all Persons will show. If an non-empty `FILTERLISTNAME` was be inputed in All Job Screen mode, or if no `FILTERLISTNAME` was be inputed in JOb Detail Screen mode, then `ClearFilterCommandParser` throws a `CommandException` and displays an error message to the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to parse parameters in filter command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `FilterCommandParse` Create a `predicatePersonDescriptor` object and parse it to `FilterCommand`
** Pros:
*** Make filterCommand more comparable. We can compare `predicatePersonDescriptor` to say whether two filter Command is same.
*** Have better contol on a Filtercommand.
** Cons: Logic is indirect.
* **Alternative 2:** `FilterCommandParse` combine all conditions (parameters) in a Predicate and parse it to `FilterCommand`
** Pros: Logic is direct.
** Cons: Predicate interface is incomparable so this make test more difficult.

===== Aspect: How to design a filter name restricted format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filter name can be any String.
** Pros:
*** Make Filter name more flexible.
*** A filter may include many information. But user can only see this filter by it's Filter name label. So it should allow user make a more detailed name for memory and control.
** Cons: Because user can take unpredictable signas their filter name, so it may cause unpredictable bugs.
* **Alternative 2:** Filter name should only be restricted in the specified format
** Pros: Easy to control and handle error.
** Cons: User more need more complicated filter name.

===== Aspect: How to handle filter grade and interview scores

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filter parameter become a value range and person's score in this range will be returned.
** Pros:
*** Make more sense on filtering value related field.
*** HR manager like to know peron's score in a range, not exactly in a specified value.
** Cons: May add additional logic and error handling.
* **Alternative 2:** Same logic as other field
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: HR manager like to know peron's score in a range, not exactly equal to a specified value.

// end::filter[]

=== Analytics Feature
==== Current Implementation

The analytics is facilitated by the Analytics class. Analytics data are generated in real time depending on the specific job currently on display in the software by the user. Hence it will not be saved as states in the `versionedAddressBook`. It pulls required person list to generate data from Model, which consists of lists: `displayedFilter`, `activeJobAllApplicants`, `activeJobKiv`, `activeJobInterview`, `activeJobShortist`. An `Analytics` object will be created by Analytics class, storing the various required data generated, and pass it to Logic and UI for display.

Given below is the sequence diagram for `analytics`:

image::AnalyticsDiagram.png[width="790"]

// tag::interviews[]
=== Interviews Feature
==== Current Implementation

The interviews and its functionalities are facilitated by the Interviews class.
It is a private field present in the versionedAddressBook, to facilitate the integration of interviews and its functions with undo/redo operation in slaveFinder().
(Show is not counted as an operation and hence it is not saved as a state).
The reason for using Calendar over LocalDate is that in v2.0, the app can be upgrade to schedule interviews for any time instead of only scheduling by days.
The Interview class acts as an association class between calendar and person.

image::InterviewsAssociationClass.png[width="650"]

For the generate command. There are total 2 parameters that determines how the interviews list is generated.
The 2 parameters are: maxInterviewsADay and blockOutDates.
maxInterviewsADay determines the number of interviews that can be scheduled a day and it is saved in the interviews class
blockOutDates are the user's own block out dates which represent unavailable dates that the user is not free and therefore interviews cannot be scheduled.
Another thing to note is that weekends are not considered in the scheduled as the user is assumed to have normal working hours from Monday to Friday.

Given below is the sequence diagram for generateInterviews:

image::GenerateInterviewsDiagram.png[width="650"]

An example of generateInterviews:

Step 1. User launches the application. The blockOutDates field in the interviews class is currently empty.

Step 2. User sets the block out dates with setBlockOutDates command. User does not change the max interviews a day and it is set to a default value of 2.

Step 3. User request for interviews to be generated.

Step 4. Interviews are generated with the restriction based on the parameters and working hours of a normal working adult.

Interviews also works with deletePerson, that is, when a person is deleted, he/she is also removed from his/her scheduled interview slots.

image::InterviewsDeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

An example of deleting a person:

Step 1. User launches the application and generates interviews.

Step 2. User deletes the person from slaveFinder()

Step 3. Person is removed from his/her scheduled interview date

interviews.removePerson(p) is called. A collection of ArrayList of person is taken from the HashMap and since the collection is backed by the map, any changes to the collection will be reflected in the hashmap.
Thus removal of person will be reflected in the hashmap. Therefore this method of removal was used.

// end::interviews[]

===== Aspect: How interviews is integrated with delete Person command

* When a person is removed, naturally he/she should also be removed from the scheduled interviews. A remove person function is implemented in interviews which potentially could be used by the v2.0 reschedule command to remove or reschedule persons for interviews.

===== Aspect: How interviews is integrated with existing undo/redo

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** In order to hinge on the existing undo/redo command, interviews was implemented as a field in AddressBook.java. In the event that undo and redo is called, the data is reset to that of a previous state.
In the current implementation, the data is copied over and could take up a lot of time if there is a large amount of dates to copy over.

** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Performance issues may arise in terms of memory usage

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a function that keeps track of what the user does to interviews and each time a undo is called, the previous command's inverse function is called.

** Pros: Less memory is used
** Cons: Need to consider all possible commands, when adding new command, need to include an inverse command.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
